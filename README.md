# CardioPulmonary ChatMed: AI-Powered Heart & Lung Health Checker

BYS Health Center

BYS Health Center is a web application designed to detect lung cancer and heart cancer using AI models. The platform utilizes machine learning models trained and tested with extensive data to predict potential heart and lung cancer based on user-provided symptoms.
Features

    Cancer Detection: The application employs machine learning models for lung and heart cancer detection, utilizing pickle files containing trained models.
    Chatbot Interface: A chatbot interface prompts users with questions related to symptoms associated with heart and lung cancer to gather relevant data. It analyzes the user input and tests the corresponding heart and lung cancer models to determine potential diagnoses.
    Multiple Input Modes: Users can input symptoms either through keyboard interaction or by using the voice assistant feature, allowing spoken input for text generation.
    Technologies Used: Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, the web interface ensures a seamless user experience.
    Animations and Accuracy: The web application incorporates high-quality animations and ensures high accuracy in the predictive models for cancer detection.
    Machine Learning Models:
        Heart Cancer Detection: Utilizes XGBoost as the underlying model for heart cancer detection.
        Lung Cancer Detection: Implements a decision tree model for lung cancer prediction.
